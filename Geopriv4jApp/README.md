# Geopriv4jApp
A sample android application that implements the geopriv4j open-source project.

## Design
* This application uses the Maps SDK for android to collect the GPS locations.
* Here we are using the simple MapsActivity to simulate privacy using the rounding algorithm implemented in the geopriv4j project


## Privacy Methodology:
* We snap each latitude and longitude to the nearest point on a square grid with spacing âˆ† in meters.
