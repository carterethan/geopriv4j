# testApp
A sample android application that implements the geopriv4j open-source project.

## Design
* This application uses the Maps SDK for android to collect the GPS locations.
* Here we are using the simple MapsActivity to simulate privacy using the rounding algorithm implemented in the geopriv4j project

* There are example classes defined for 7 algorithms located in 'testApp/app/src/main/com.geopriv4j/'. To try out each algorithm, you must edit 'testApp/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml'. Find 'android:name' in the activity tag and change "MapsActivity____" to the desired class name.


*Installation Note:* You will need to enable "Maps SDK for Android" on the Google Developer Console and provide your own API key in the testApp code. The API key must be entered in 'testApp/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml' under the value for com.google.android.geo.API_KEY.


## Privacy Methodology:
* We snap each latitude and longitude to the nearest point on a square grid with spacing âˆ† in meters.
